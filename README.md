# pymerchant - working title
Python based trading game inspired by old school merchant trading simulations such as Vermeer and Patrician.

# Premise
You are a traveling merchant who is starting out and looking to grow your business. You travel between distant cities buying and selling products with the aim of increasing your wealth through your earned profits. Each city has specialized supply and demand for any given item so the key is to find opportunity where you can.

There are be a variety of city/market types, each with their own unique economies. And each city can be upgraded in Tiers by player actions to open up more trade possibilities and higher profits.

# Requirements - as outlined in initial project pitch

> 1. You are a trader in either in "olden time" or fantasy world and travel from city to city buying wholesale commodities to transport and sell elsewhere
> 2. Prices are function of supply and demand at city level (fluctuations due to world events, or projects, other competitors, businesses)
> 3. You can ask in cities about rumors and news, which will hint at future supply and demand changes, thereby give you knowledge about pricing
> 4. Game is played on a 360 day 12 month year, where each day you can trade, travel, or wait.

Game is open per requirements, to traveling via ship or caravan, could explore a world traveling game instead of just a regional city trader game.

# Elements of play

1. Buying and Selling - Trading at Cities
2. Traveling to other cities - Not all cities are connected to one another (would depend if travel by boat or travel by caravan)
3. Managing inventory - limited inventory space (need to expand inventory space by increasing ship size or caravan size
4. Interaction at city level - Influence NPCs and cities to give you news or rumors, influence production elements to change supply and demand yourself



#This project has been about 40 days in the making
# I drew inspiration for this game from some of my favorite trading simulation games
# such as Vermeer, The Patrician IV, Port Royale, 1869 
# 
# I set out with a goal to capture the simple elements of these games that were enjoyable
# I studied Finance and Economics and have a BBA in Finance from Texas State 2014
#
# As such, I was really most interested in constructing a trading simulation that might have a little more rigor than just purely random numbers and outputs. 
# Update 4/21/24 - revisiting project to see what easy improvements can be made to the game with my knowledge now
